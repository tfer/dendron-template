## On Hierarchies

Rigid hierarchies can result in friction to getting thoughts in but having no hierarchy can be problematic in getting notes back out. Dendron tries to walk the line by letting you create links between any two arbitrary notes but also layering on top a flexible hierarchy that lets you prescribe a canonical organization of your notes. See more thoughts on the matter [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e9c72b4f-adb8-4f15-a6aa-9f9d81538561.html).
